### Open Book Exam

- Bring any (analog) materials you want

- Nothing to memorize

---
class:top

### Not "bell-curved"

- Your grade is based solely on your marks

- Not relative to others in the class.

---
class:top

### Plagiarism and Cheating

- "No mercy" policy in dealing with guilty cases

- Not worth it to cheat/copy

---

## Words of Advice

---
class: center,middle

## Expected workload
### 10 hours/week

But your mileage may vary

---
class: top

### Learning in NUS SoC:

- Less rote learning

- More open-ended problems

- A lot more self-learning

---
class: middle

### _Don't_: Stop at understanding the notes

### _Do_: "play" with it, ask "what if..", "why..", "why not..", etc

---
class: middle

### _Don't:_ do it alone

### _Do:_ Discuss with classmates and teaching team

---
class: middle

### _Don't:_ Optimize for CAP and grades

### _Do:_ Optimize for skills, knowledge, and experience

---
class: middle

### _Don't:_ Do enough to get things done

### _Do:_ Invest time to master the tools

(e.g., `bash`, `vim`, `git`, etc)

---
class: middle,wide

### _Don't:_ focus on meeting assignment deadline

### _Do:_ think long term (your career)

---
class: middle

- No matter how well you have done to get here
- No matter what you know about programming

### This is a fresh start

# Lecture 1

### 9 August 2021

Admin Matters<br>
Unit 1: **What is a Program?**<br>
Unit 2: **Computational Problems and Algorithms**<br>

---
class: middle,center

## What is a program?
---
class: middle,center

### A sequence of step-by-step instructions given to computers to process data in order to perform a certain task.
---
class: center

### How CPU Executes a Program

.fit[![simplified](../figures/cpu-memory/cpu-memory-pdf.png)]

.tiny[(A highly simplfied view)]

---
### Machine Code

- Instructions that can be interpreted by a CPU

- Different CPU architecture may use different instruction sets

`1001010001011110100010101010101000101`

---
### Assembly Language

- Use mnemonic to represent the instructions such as `incr`, `decr`, `store`, etc. in a more human-readable way.

- Still difficult to write: operation that is conceptually simple still requires multiple instructions to be issued.

---
### Higher-Level Language

- Allow programmers to express an operation closer to their intention

- E.g., $x = x + y$ if $y < 0$


---
### Higher-Level Languages

- FORTRAN (first popular programming language from 1950s)

- C (1972, still influential today)

- [Many many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

### Why C?

- It lets you have more control over how you use memory.  
- It forces students to think and understand how machine works.
- It is fast.

Important for InfoSec and CEG students.

---
### Compilation

A compiler _compiles_ a program written in high-level language to machine code.

---

### How to Solve It?

- Scan the integers one-by-one

- Keep track of the "max so far"

- When we are done scanning, the "max so far" will be the answer.

---
class: top

### Problem Formulation

- Input: $L$ = $\langle l\_0,...,l\_{k-1\} \rangle$

- Output: $m$

- Constraint $m \in L$ and $m \ge l_i$ for all $i$.

---
class: top

### Scan One-By-One

- $l_i$ : The number being scanned

- Set $i$ to $0, 1, \ldots k-1$

---
class: top

### "Maximum So Far"

- $m$ : max so far

- Set $m$ to $l_0$ initially

---
class: top

### Keeping track 

- Compare $m$ with $l\_i$.

- If $m < l\_i$, then update $m$ with the value of $l\_i$.

---
class: top

### Done scanning?

- When we have scanned $l\_{k-1}$.

---
class: middle

### These steps to solve a computational problem form the _algorithm_.

---
class: top

### Flowchart

---
class: top

![:scale 75%](../figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-0.png)

.smaller.center[
$k$ | $i$ | $l\_i$ | $m$ 
:---|:----|--------|-----
    |     |        |  
    |     |        |  
    |     |        |  
    |     |        |    
]

---
### Variables

- $i$, $m$, $k$ are _variables_

- A variable has a corresponding location in the memory and hold a _value_

- You can _read_ a value from a variable

- You can _write_ a value to a variable

---
### Assignment

- We can assign the value of a variable to a constant (e.g., set $i$ to 1)

- or to the value of another variable (e.g., set $m$ to $l_i$).

---
### Comparison

- We can compare the values of two variables

- E.g., $i$ equals $k$?  $l\_i > m$? 

---
### Arithmetic Operations

- We can perform arithmetic operations 

- E.g., we set $i$ to $i + 1$

---
### Does this algorithm always correctly find the maximum value? 

.fit[![flowchart](../figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-0.png)]

---
### Correctness 

- If an algorithm produces the correct output for one instance of input, it is not necessary correct

- To be correct, it has to produce the correct output _for all possible_ inputs!

---
### How to check for correctness?

- Carefully choose a set of test cases to try

- Argue formally about the properties of the algorithms
---
### Homework

- Post-Lecture Diagnostic Quiz
  - Due next Wednesday 2359
  - You have unlimited attempts

- Problem Set 2.1 to 2.3 
  - Not graded.  To be discussed Week 3.

- List of TODOs on in my [welcome message](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/22421/discussion_topics/2659)
